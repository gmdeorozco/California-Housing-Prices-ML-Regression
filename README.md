**Title: Regression Algorithms Comparison on Diabetes Dataset**

## Overview

Welcome to the Regression Algorithms Comparison on Diabetes Dataset GitHub repository! This project focuses on exploring and comparing various regression algorithms using the Diabetes dataset. The Diabetes dataset contains ten baseline variables and a quantitative measure of disease progression one year after baseline. By applying different regression algorithms to this dataset, we aim to understand their performance and identify the most suitable regression model for predicting diabetes progression based on medical features.

## Introduction

Regression analysis is a vital tool in machine learning for predicting continuous values. This repository provides an opportunity to explore several regression algorithms' implementations and understand how they perform on the Diabetes dataset. By comparing different regression models, we aim to gain insights into their strengths and limitations in handling medical data for predicting disease progression.

## Diabetes Dataset

The Diabetes dataset contains ten baseline variables, including age, gender, body mass index (BMI), and blood serum measurements. The target variable is a quantitative measure of disease progression one year after baseline. This dataset provides a real-world regression problem, allowing us to evaluate regression algorithms' accuracy in predicting diabetes progression based on medical attributes.

## Algorithms

The repository includes implementations of the following regression algorithms:

1. Linear Regression
2. Ridge Regression
3. Lasso Regression
4. Decision Tree Regression
5. Random Forest Regression
6. Gradient Boosting Regression

Each algorithm is thoroughly documented, and code examples showcase their application to the Diabetes dataset.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gmdeorozco/Diabetes-Regression-Algorithms-Comparison.git
```

2. Install the required Python libraries, such as scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib.

3. Run the Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts to observe the regression models' performance on the Diabetes dataset.
